Sections needed

	- user (u_id, g_id, paid/not-paid, logged in?, member/regular, premium, user_level etc)
	- ids (c_id, cm_id, ce_id, t_id, etc)
	- slide info (slide_time, etc.)
	- time info
	- content type? (exclusif, reserve, public, cm_kind)
	- some kind of id?

Fields needed:

	u_id
	u_username
	u_level
	paid
	member
	premium
	g_id
	c_id
	dc_id
	ct_id
	c_name
	c_visible
	c_disable
	ces_id
	fct_id
	content_type
	cm_id
	ce_id
	t_id
	slide_id
	usl_slide_no
	mobile
	slide_time (usl_date_out - usl_date_in)
	conference_type
	content_type
	content_qual
	timestamp

The fields above take care of all the logs that can be generated from user_slide_log{mobile,} and document_library_log (I think, double-check)

We also need to cover stats for other types of content like:
	
	- audipodcasts and other types of content
	- downloads
	- quiz et tests (resultats)
	- authors? (if yes, need to include cm_speaker and other fields like that)
	- 

Explanation of different fields

	- mobile: will be a flag for if the line relates to a mobile stats or not (since the fields are the same for slides viewed in both user_slide_log and user_slide_log_mobile
	- content_qual: one of exclusif, reserve or public
	-
